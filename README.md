# weather-scraper
This project will collect daily peak temperatures from The Weather Network for Vancouver, as well as give a nice website to view it on.

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3+

## Starting the project:
```bash
python index.py
```

Once running, you can view the graph in the browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000 . You can leave it running on a Raspberry Pi, for example, and it will continue to collect data for you.
